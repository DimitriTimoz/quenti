I don't have the crayons to explain this one to you.
I hope you lose weight so there'll be less of you.
You're really hard to look at.
Well... people tolerate you.
I expected nothing, but I’m still disappointed.
Your train of thought is a replacement bus service.
When it was raining brains, you had an umbrella.
I would agree with you, but then we would both be wrong.
Your IQ is roughly around room temperature.
If you spoke your mind, you'd be speechless.
You have a hidden talent. Keep it hidden.
Aww, it's so cute when you try to talk about things you don't understand.
I bet you drink milk with a fork.
You are so stupid, you'd trip over a cordless phone.
Ordinary people live and learn. You just live.
Brains aren't everything. In your case they're nothing.
If your brain exploded, it wouldn't even mess up your hair.
If you were any dumber, I would have to water you twice a week.
Good job answering questions!
You’re impossible to underestimate.
You’re not the dumbest person on the planet, but you sure better hope he doesn’t die.
If you were an inanimate object, you’d be a participation trophy.
You’re so dense, light bends around you.
You’re dumber than I tell people.
You know, people were right about you.
How can your IQ be in single numbers?
You do realize we tolerate you.
Ah, sharp as a marble that one!
The wheel is spinning, but the hamster is dead.
You're really more foam than beer.
At this point, you can only impress me.
A village somewhere is missing their idiot.
You could actually hide your own Easter eggs.
Only two brain cells left and both of them are fighting for third place.
You are sad, you have my pity. Just kidding.
